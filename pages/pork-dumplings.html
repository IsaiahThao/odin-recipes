    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3 cloves of mined garlic</li>
        <li>1 beaten egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of chopped chives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced ginger</li>
        <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>1 cup of vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the filling for the dumplins combine your pork, garlic, eggs, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil,
            and ginger into a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle.</li>
        <li>Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and 
        cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.</li>
    </ol>
